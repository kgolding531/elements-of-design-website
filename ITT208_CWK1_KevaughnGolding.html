					In web design, it is important to display information to users in a way that will allow them to understand what
					is being shown to them. They guide the arangement and outline of the website which ultimately influence the look and 
					overall feel of the site as well as the message it presents.
					Below are some characteristics that govern how an effective website should look like.<br/>

		<h1 id="content">1. Content</h1>
		<p> The quote “content is king” by Bill Gates stands true in web design. Effective content requires proper research 
			into the website’s main <strong>audience</strong> and its <strong>purpose</strong>. It then requires careful selection of different media (such as 
			videos and graphics) as well as the manner in which they will appear to visitors <cite>(Resource Techniques, 2019)</cite>. 
			Content must be high-calibre, pertinent and appealing.</p>
		<p> Due to the usually high volume of information presented on websites, content needs to be organized and prioritized 
			in a way that will help users locate what they need quickly while improving Search Engine Optimization (SEO). 
			Experts conclude that a website’s content is <strong>highly essential</strong> for its ranking in search engines <cite>(Textbroker, 2021)</cite>.</p>

		<!-- SECOND PARAGRAPH -->
		
		<h1 id="visual">2. Visual Hierarchy</h1>
		<p> The positioning of elements in order of priority is another characteristic of effective web design. According to 
			<cite>Marianne (2021)</cite>, visual hierarchy may be achieved through visual contrast: size, <strong>colour</strong>, typography, whitespace and 
			style. This feature is relevant as it establishes a main point for visitors to find the information they need the most. 
			Balance is the key.</p>
		<p><cite>Duckett (2011, pp. 467–468)</cite> outlines some of these features in their book:</p>
		<ol type="a">
			<li><b>Size</b> - the larger the element, the more attention it will grab. Essential for key points and headings.</li>
			<li><b>Colour</b> - <strong>brighter areas</strong> are more attractive. Foreground and background colours must be appropriate.</li>
				<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
					<li>Complementary colours such as <strong>purple</strong> and yellow go well together.</li>
					<li> Colours can be psychological. Green for example illustrates nature and health, says 
				<a href="https://99designs.com/blog/tips/website-color-schemes/" target="_blank"><cite>Jennifer (99designs)</cite>.</a></li>
					<li> Certain colour schemes can be found and tested online. These involve a combination of suitable colours to 
						 produce a general theme</li>
				</ul>
				<li><b>Imagery</b> - the right image can tell more than a page of text. They often draw lots of attention.</li>
		</ol>

		</a>
		
		<!-- THIRD PARAGRAPH -->
		
		<h1 id="organization">3. Organization</h1>
		<p> This characteristic speaks to grouping related pieces of information together to make the website appear <strong>simpler</strong> 
			and easy to understand. Similar visual styles can also be organized such that visitors are familiarized with a 
			particular type of content <cite>(Duckett, 2011, p. 465)</cite>.</p>
		<p><cite>Marianne (2021)</cite> outlines two notable methods of organization:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> <u>Grid-based Layout</u> - this structure helps to align elements on the webpage and lays out content in a fixed, 
				 grid formation with well-adjusted columns and sections.</li>
			<li> <u>F-shaped pattern</u> - eye-tracking studies prove that the majority of what people observe is located at <strong>the top 
				 and left sections</strong> of the screen. This layout replicates the left-right and top-bottom natural way of reading to 
				 guide readers to relevant information.</li>
		</ul>
		<p> Organization also enhances navigation and '<strong>dwell time</strong>' as visitors will not remain on a website that is confusing 
			and unorganized.</p>

		</a>
		
		<!-- FOURTH PARAGRAPH -->
		
		<h1 id="responsive">4. Responsiveness</h1>
		<p> Engaging the audience is important in making a website <strong>stand out</strong> and ultimately successful. An interactive and 
			responsive website will accomplish this through different methods:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> <b>Mobile compatible</b> - Many people access the internet and websites via their mobile devices, hence a responsive 
				 layout for various viewpoints and different-sized screens will prove to be beneficial <cite>(Marianne, 2021)</cite>.</li>
			<li> <b>Relevant links</b> - links must be of a sufficient size and they must carry a special appearance such as changing 
				 colour when a user hovers over them or having a unique, <strong>visual difference</strong> from the other content 
				 <cite>(Duckett, 2011, p. 472)</cite>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The aim is to hold the audience’s attention and get them to remain on the website. This is a simple yet <strong>highly 
		powerful</strong> characteristic of effective website design.</p>

		</a>
		
		<!-- FIFTH PARAGRAPH -->
		
		<h1 id="load">5. Time for Loading</h1>
		<p> The fifth and final point for effective web design is the load time. Website load time refers to the time it takes 
			for the content (imagery, text and videos) of the website to completely load and show to the user <cite>(Baker, 2022)</cite>. 
			It appears that “<strong>nearly 70%</strong> of consumers admit that page speed impacts their willingness to buy from an online 
			retailer. (Unbounce, 2019)” <cite>(Baker, 2022, “11 Page Load Time Statistics” section, para. 4)</cite>. The <strong>first 3 seconds</strong> of a 
			website’s load time are crucial as this time determines whether or not web visitors will remain on the page 
			<cite>(Marianne, 2021)</cite>.</p>
		<p>The attribute of load time impacts conversion rates and overall user experience. It is essential that developers 
		and designers know these five effective characteristics and apply them to every website they create to improve 
		their skills and satisfy visitors. <a href="#top">Jump To Top</a></p>
